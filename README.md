**Project Overview**

This Excel dashboard provides a clear and comprehensive overview of sales, profit, and customer activity for Theo Anderson Stores. Built with dynamic visualisations and structured data models, the dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand performance patterns and uncover actionable insights across products, countries, and periods.
Business Objective
Theo Anderson Stores needed a simple, intuitive reporting solution to track performance and identify what’s driving or hindering sales growth. This Excel-based dashboard was developed to support timely decision-making by presenting key business metrics in a visual, interactive format.

Total Profit: $270,274
Customer Base: 2,026 unique customers

**Country Performance**
Canada led all regions with $326,002 in sales
USA followed with $288,813
Mexico contributed just $5,394, showing room for growth or a need to reassess market fit

**Product Performance**
Top-selling categories include:
Soccer products: $180,162

Outdoor products recorded the lowest sales at $23,865

**Best-selling product lines**:

**Customer Insights**
One customer, Smith, generated $173,705 in total sales. Other top customers (Sanchez, Williams, Nelson, Johnson) each contributed between $2,900 and $4,700.
This highlights the importance of identifying and retaining high-value clients.

**Time-Based Trends**
January stood out with $283,661 in sales. Sales dipped significantly in the following months, especially February, August, and October. This points to seasonal demand or missed sales opportunities in quieter periods.

**Weekly Profit Patterns**
Friday and Sunday were the most profitable days, Tuesday and Wednesday had the lowest profit margins, indicating potential for targeted weekday campaigns

**Strategic Recommendations**
1.	Focus efforts on Canada and the USA where demand is strongest
2.	Explore marketing strategies or market fit assessments for Mexico
3.	Launch midweek promotions to drive weekday sales
4.	Deepen engagement with top-performing customers through loyalty programs or exclusive offers
5.	Reevaluate the outdoor category to understand why it is underperforming
6.	Review January sales strategies to replicate their success in other months
